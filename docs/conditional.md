# **Conditional Logic**

Kforms has an easy to use syntax for displaying specific fields, sections, and pages based on prior field inputs. 

For example, if you’re building a form and don’t want to overwhelm users with useless fields that they don’t need to fill out, consider only displaying fields based on a previous response.

In the home inspection form example, The first field type we encounter is a yes/no field. Based on the user response to this field, Kforms can display additional fields for the user to interact with. In this case, if a home inspector notices that the home has a pool, she may want to then check if the diving boards and slides are securely anchored, make sure the water pump’s pressure gauge reading is accounted for, and whether or not he or she needed to clean the pressure filter. You can imagine that in very complex forms, unnecessary fields should be hidden if possible as not to overwhelm user activity.
