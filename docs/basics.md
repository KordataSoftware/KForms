### **Kform**
A Kform is the parent container in which forms are created. 
### **Kpage**
An optional feature of a Kform is to break up forms into multiple pages. Pages are not necessary, but they can provide for an optimal UX when filling out a mobile form.
### **Ksection**
Forms are broken up into sections in order to logically group different fields. These sections have the ability to be hidden when not in use
### **Kfield**
Each KSection contains one or more Kfields. Each Kfield has out of the box functionality and Kforms also has the ability for developers to generate their own field types that will be able to integrate with Kforms as well.
### **FormSaveContext**
